Pixel Quest is an open-source, beginner-friendly project where you can learn coding by building a pixel-art multiplayer adventure game. Join in to practice programming, contribute features, and collaborate with others in a creative and supportive environment.

# Overview

Pixel-Powered Revision Tracker is a fun, web-based productivity tool designed to help students manage their study sessions while earning rewards. It combines Pomodoro-style timers with a pixel-art companion and customisable virtual space, turning revision into a motivating, interactive experience.

## Project Goals

- Help students stay focused and organised during revision.
- Introduce a rewarding system using pixel currency to boost engagement.
- Create a customisable virtual ‘home’ for a pixel buddy character.
- Encourage healthy study habits through flexible timers and regular breaks.
- Build an appealing, user-friendly web app accessible on any device.

## Features (Planned)

- Customisable study session durations (not just fixed 25/5 Pomodoro).
- Pixel buddy character that lives in a basic home which users can upgrade.
- Earn pixel currency by completing study sessions.
- Spend currency on furniture, decorations, and house upgrades.
- A revision session log/tracker to monitor progress over time.
- Optional background music/white noise.
- Simple motivational quotes or messages after each session.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (core frontend)
- Possibly Local Storage for saving session data and upgrades
- GitHub Pages for deployment
- Pixel Art Assets designed manually or using a pixel editor

## Inspiration
Inspired by productivity apps like Habitica and Forest, combined with nostalgic pixel games like Stardew Valley and Tamagotchi-style companions, I aim to bring joy and motivation to everyday revision sessions in a fresh, student-friendly way.

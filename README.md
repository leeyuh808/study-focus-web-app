Pixel-Powered Revision Tracker is a web-based productivity app designed to make studying more rewarding and fun. It combines a revision planner with a Pomodoro-style study timer, allowing users to earn pixel art coins as they complete study sessions. These coins can be spent on customising your virtual character and upgrading your in-app study space.

Track your study hours, view subject-specific stats, and stay motivated with pixel art rewards as you build productive habits. Perfect for students who want to stay organised, track their progress, and enjoy a little nostalgia while they work.

# Overview

Pixel-Powered Revision Tracker is a fun, web-based productivity tool designed to help students manage their study sessions while earning rewards. It combines Pomodoro-style timers with a pixel-art companion and customisable virtual space, turning revision into a motivating, interactive experience.

## Inspiration
Inspired by productivity apps like Habitica and Forest, combined with nostalgic pixel games like Stardew Valley and Tamagotchi-style companions, I aim to bring joy and motivation to everyday revision sessions in a fresh, student-friendly way.
